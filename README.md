My code for Advent of Code 2024. 
Problems were solved using Godot and GDscript first, and then later ported to Rust for learning purposes.
Runtime comparisons can be found in code_times.ods. GDscript numbers will be lower than expected due to rounding down to the nearest ms and input documents being preloaded.
